# MachineLearning
Machine learning projects in MatLab. I implemented algorithms for a Principal Component Analysis, Multiple Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayes' Classification, and k Nearest Neighbor Classification. I used MatLab's toolbox to implement a Support Vector Machine using a linear kernel and polynomial kernel. I used the MNIST data set of handwritten digits for classification, it contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
