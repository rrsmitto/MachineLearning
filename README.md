# MachineLearning
Machine learning projects in MatLab. I implemented algorithms for a Principal Component Analysis, Multiple Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayes' Classification, and k Nearest Neighbor Classification. Using MatLab's toolbox I trained a Support Vector Machine using a linear kernel and polynomial kernel. All of the classification was performed on subsets of the MNIST data set of handwritten digits.
